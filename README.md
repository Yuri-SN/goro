Goro supports yaml configuration for your service modules.
Download an example yaml config:

```bash
curl -o goro.yaml https://github.com/hanagantig/goro/blob/main/example/testapp/goro.yaml
```
After that you can run `init` command with the config

**Voila!** You have your service. You can run and check the `ping` http method generated by default.
